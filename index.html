        <p>
          I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and
          now I am seeking my first professional programming job. I am a
          highly-motivated individual with a deep passion for programming and I
          am looking to bring my skills to the next level in a professional
          capacity.
          <br />
          <br />
          Although I have only just finished school, I have been programming as
          a hobby for over ten years now. Through this I have acquired a very
          solid foundation and understanding of CS fundamentals including data
          structures, algorithms, and architecture.
          <br />
          <br />
          I primarily use Javascript and Python for my projects, however I have
          used many different languages including C++, PHP, SQL, and Java just
          to name a few. Through learning multiple languages I have become
          confident in my ability to learn a new language very quickly if
          needed. I have also had experience using multiple popular frameworks
          such as React, ReactNative, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the years I have built many different types of programs ranging
          from one-off scripts meant to accomplish a simple task to full-on
          web-based and mobile apps. I have experience in every aspect of a
          full-stack development environment including server
          creation/management, databases, back-end/API development, security,
          authorization, and font-end development.
          <br />
          <br />
          To support myself through school I worked as a Math and Computer
          Science tutor, while simultaneously working multiple positions at
          various restaurants. From my experience as a tutor I gained better
          communication skills that allow me to really understand a person's
          needs and explain difficult concepts in a way that is easy for them to
          understand. From working in restaurants for over ten years I have
          learned time-management, multi-tasking, conflict resolution, teamwork,
          and the ability to remain flexible and think of solutions on the fly
          when problems occur.
